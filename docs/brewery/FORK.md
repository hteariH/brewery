# Working on the Brewery fork

## Rules

1. Brewery code lives in `crates/brewery_*` and `script/brewery/`.
2. Inside files that came from Zed, keep edits to short hook-ins and mark each
   with `brewery:` (`// brewery:` in Rust/JSONC, `# brewery:` in TOML/YAML/shell).
   `script/brewery/list-hooks` prints them all.
3. Never rename or delete Zed crates. Switch features off instead
   (`brewery_cloud::ZED_CLOUD_ENABLED`, default settings, command palette filter).
4. Zed's GitHub workflows are deleted; Brewery's CI is `.github/workflows/brewery_ci.yml`.

## Merging upstream (monthly)

    git checkout main
    script/brewery/merge-upstream
    cargo test -p brewery_cloud -p brewery_core -p brewery_theme -p release_channel -p paths -p settings -p client
    script/brewery/list-hooks   # every hook still present?

The script resolves Zed workflow changes (kept deleted) and `README.md` (ours).
Everything else it leaves to you and lists.

## Regenerating look assets

    python script/brewery/gen_themes.py            # after Zed changes assets/themes/one/one.json
    python script/brewery/fetch_intellij_icons.py  # after Zed adds icon keys
